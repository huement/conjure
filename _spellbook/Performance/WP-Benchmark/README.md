VW BenchMark II - WordPress profiling/debugging tool
===================================================
#### Plugin install
**** Requires PHP 5+ ****

Useful for debugging and profiling your WordPress sites server side code (PHP, Queries, Includes, Hooks, Query Errors, Constants).

Or even locating features such as listing available WP Hooks.

Most of this is code that I have always used in my WP development process and thought I would make it into a plugin and available to everyone.

Simply upload like any other plugin to the plugin directory and activate.

Visit the settings page to set options for debugging or profiling.


Example of the profile output
----------------------------------------------
Note that TwentyTen is lighter in all areas.
