# @ALERT WP_Conjure has a Wordpress auto updated dev site. It requires the following 3 options. If you remove them it will break
#        the Wordpress dev site installer and updater functions. So don't remove these entries from this file.
#
#        1. 'wpdev' option from databases,
#        2. 'wpdev.app' section from sites
#        3. 'www/wpdev' from folders
#
# @ALERT If you are adding a Wordpress Site. Declare the type as wordpress and make sure that there is NO TRAILING SLASH.
#
# @INFO  You can declare a site as being a "Wordpress" install if you add these options to your normal site block.
#               type: "wordpress"
#               wpup: "https://myriadmobile.com"
