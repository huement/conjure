# @ALERT WP_Conjure has a Wordpress auto updated dev site. It requires the following 3 options. If you remove them it will break
#        the Wordpress dev site installer and updater functions. So don't remove these entries from this file.
#
#        1. 'wpdev' option from databases,
#        2. 'wpdev.app' section from sites
#        3. 'www/wp_dev' from folders
